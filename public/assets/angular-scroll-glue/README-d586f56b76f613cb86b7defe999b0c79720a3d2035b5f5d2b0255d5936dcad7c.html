<h2>Contribute</h2>

<p>Despite this is a ultra specialized library, there will always be a fix to be made or a new feature to be added and I'm glad for any contributions. But please make sure to check the following before committing a pull request:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure the unit tests pass. Just run <code>npm test</code> and check if all is green.</li>
<li>Try to add new tests that cover your changes.</li>
<li>Make sure you do not introduce changes that break backward compatibility unless there is a really good reason to.</li>
</ol>
