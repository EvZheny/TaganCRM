<p>The library is open source and lives on GitHub at:
https://github.com/googlemaps/js-rich-marker
Open an issue or fork the library and submit a pull request.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that before we can accept any pull requests we have to jump
through a couple of legal hurdles, primarily a Contributor License Agreement
(CLA):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>If you are an individual writing original source code</strong>
and you're sure you own the intellectual property,
then you'll need to sign an
<a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual">individual CLA</a>.</li>
<li><strong>If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work</strong>,
then you'll need to sign a
<a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate">corporate CLA</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and
instructions for how to sign and return it.</p>

<p>When preparing your code, make sure to update the AUTHORS and CONTRIBUTORS file
to reflect your contribtion.</p>

<p>Once we receive your CLA, we'll be able to review and accept your pull requests.</p>
